Creating a "Think Library" of reusable AI models and automation involves organizing, documenting, 
 and storing your AI models and code in a structured manner. Below is a conceptual guide; 
 note that specific implementation may vary based on your technology stack and organization's practices.

**1. Folder Structure:**
   Organize your library with a clear folder structure for different types of AI models and automations.

   ```plaintext
   /ThinkLibrary
   ├── Models
   │   ├── ImageRecognition
   │   ├── NaturalLanguageProcessing
   │   └── ...
   ├── Automations
   │   ├── DataProcessing
   │   ├── Reporting
   │   └── ...
   └── README.md
   ```

**2. Documentation:**
   Include documentation for each model and automation to explain its purpose, inputs, outputs, and usage.

   ```markdown
   ### ImageRecognition Model

   **Description:** This model identifies objects in images using convolutional neural networks (CNN).

   **Input:** Image data in PNG or JPEG format.

   **Output:** JSON with detected objects and confidence scores.

   **Usage:**
   ```python
   from ThinkLibrary.Models.ImageRecognition import identify_objects

   result = identify_objects(image_path='path/to/image.jpg')
   print(result)
   ```

   Follow a similar structure for automation.

**3. Code Versioning:**
   Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes in your models and automations.

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: ImageRecognition model and DataProcessing automation."
   ```

**4. Reusable Components:**
   Create modular components that can be reused across different models or automations.

   ```plaintext
   /ThinkLibrary
   ├── Components
   │   ├── FeatureEngineering
   │   ├── DataValidation
   │   └── ...
   ```

**5. Testing:**
   Implement unit tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of each model and automation.

   ```bash
   python -m unittest test_image_recognition.py
   ```

**6. Continuous Integration:**
   Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deploying your Think Library.

   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/main.yml
   name: CI/CD

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Run tests
           run: |
             pip install -r requirements.txt
             python -m unittest discover -s tests -p '*_test.py'
   ```

**7. Collaboration:**
   Encourage collaboration by allowing team members to contribute, propose changes, and report issues.

   ```markdown
   ### Contributing

   We welcome contributions! Feel free to submit a pull request for new models, automations, or improvements.
   ```

Remember, adapt this guide based on your specific needs and the tools and frameworks you're working with.
